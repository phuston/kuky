Kuky is the world's first anonymous poetry sharing application. Think Yik-Yak, but every post has to be Haiku. 

Kuky uses our own REST backend we developed in conjunction to store and manipulate posts, users, and comments. You can check out the API's repository [here] (https://github.com/phuston/kukyserver).

Internally, Kuky leverages popular Android libraries like Butterknife for view injection and Retrofit + RxJava for all networking.
